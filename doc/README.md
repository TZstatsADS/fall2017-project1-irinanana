My project wants to find the differences between the speeches of presidents from two parties and what they have in common. The methods used in the project are topic modelling, emotional clustering and basic data processing method.

Loading pachkages and data from several websites is the first step. After processing data which include deleting the rows that have empty data, adjusting the data into the appropriate format and dividing data into two subsets, the project uses the methods mentioned above to find the relationship between the speeches of presidents from different party.

In the topic modelling part, I find ten most-likely-mentioned topics in both group: Democratic and Republican. The findings are Ùè∞äas follows: For the presidents from Democratic Party, the topics include public citizens, world peace, people's interest, family, government power, laws and regulations and how to make America better.

For the presidents from Republican Party, the topics include women, liberty, opportunities, economy, world peace, foreign policy, job, tax.

Compared to Democratic Party, the presidents of Republican were more focused on the reality problems such as jobs, tax system, opportunities of economy. Also, they emphasized ethnicity, sexism, liberty.

What they have in common is that they both mentioned the topics like world peace, family, promises of making America great again and government administrations.

In emotional clustering part, we divide the emotion into two parts: positive and negative. Finally I find both groups of presidents tend to use positive words.

By using basic data processing method, I calculate the frequency of short and long sentences. Although they use short and long sentences randomly. In general, the presidents of Democratic tend to be more likely to use short sentences than that of Republican.
